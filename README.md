## Resume and Job Description Matching Application  

This application leverages *AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing)* to intelligently compare *resumes (CVs) and job descriptions (JDs)* and rank resumes based on their relevance to the job.  

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)  

#### 1. Reading Input Files (Preprocessing - NLP)  
- The application takes a folder of resumes (CVs/) and a job description file (jd.txt).  
- It extracts text from *PDF and TXT files* using *PyMuPDF (fitz)*.  

#### 2. Cleaning and Processing Text (Preprocessing - NLP)  
- The extracted text is cleaned by removing *special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces*.  
- Converts text to *lowercase* to maintain uniformity.  

#### 3. Converting Text into Numerical Representation (AI & Machine Learning - NLP)  
- Uses *SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)* to generate *numerical embeddings* for both the *resume and job description*.  
- These embeddings capture the *meaning of words and sentences* rather than just exact word matches.  

#### 4. Matching Resumes with JD (AI - Deep Learning & ML)  
- Computes *cosine similarity* between the resume embedding and job description embedding using *SentenceTransformer & PyTorch*.  
- A *base similarity score* is calculated between the resume and the job description.  

#### 5. Skill-Based Weighting (AI - NLP & Machine Learning)  
- The user can provide skill categories: *Must-Have, Good-to-Have, and Bonus Skills*.  
- Each category has a *weight (importance level)*.  
- The similarity of each skill with the resume is calculated, and a *weighted score* is computed.  

#### 6. Ranking and Output (AI & Data Processing)  
- Resumes are *sorted based on their weighted matching percentage*.  
- The results are saved in a *results.csv* file, listing resumes with their *similarity scores*.  

This *AI-powered approach* ensures *accurate and meaningful resume-job matching*, rather than relying on simple keyword-based matching.
